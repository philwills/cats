# Free Applicative Functor

Applicative functors are a generalization of Monads allowing expressing effectful computations into a pure functional way.

Free Applicative functor is the counterpart of FreeMonads for Applicative.
Free Monads is a construction that is left adjoint to a forgetful functor from the category of Monads
